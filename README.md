# ExploreReactNativeInIntellij
Explore React Native In Intellij to develope android apps. This project is created to help understand and explore React Native development.
This project contains examples from online.


ReactNative 
Native App Development - With React Native, you don't build a "mobile web app", an "HTML5 app", or a "hybrid app". You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React. [6]

React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. [2]

Additional code is needed to get the task done by using Native code [3] [4] [5]

We may need to manage both React Native JS code and Platform Code (Android - Java, iOS - Swift or Obj-C) [3] [4] [5]

ReactNatvie has Webview which can be used for Hybrid approach - Rendering HTML in webview from WebApp [11] [12]

WebView, HTMLView Supports rendering of Latex using MathJax [9] [10]

React Native lets you build your app faster. Instead of recompiling, you can reload your app instantly. With hot reloading, you can even run new code while retaining your application state [1] [2]

ReactNative apps are also written with JavaScript – or, more specifically, they are written with the React/JSX framework. [1]

But, rather than run in a Webview like Cordova, code runs in a JavaScript engine that’s bundled with the app. ReactNative then invokes native UI components (e.g. UITabBar on iOS and Drawer on Android) via JavaScript. This means that you can create native experiences that aren’t possible with Cordova. [1]

ES2015 (also known as ES6) is a set of improvements to JavaScript that is now part of the official standard, but not yet supported by all browsers, so often it isn't used yet in web development. [7]

React Native ships with ES2015 support, so you can use this stuff without worrying about compatibility. import, from, class, extends, and the () => syntax in the example above are all ES2015 features. [7]

The other unusual thing in this code example is <Text>Hello world!</Text>. This is JSX - a syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript. Many frameworks use a special templating language which lets you embed code inside markup language. In React, this is reversed. JSX lets you write your markup language in side code. It looks like HTML on the web, except instead of web things like <div> or <span>, you use React components. In this case, <Text> is a built-in component that just displays some text. [7]
